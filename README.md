Assignment project web scraping - Japheth Newton 

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. Here's a basic outline of the steps involved in web scraping:

Inspect the Website: Use your web browser's developer tools to inspect the website's HTML structure and identify the elements containing the data you want to scrape.

Choose a Scraping Tool: Python offers several libraries for web scraping, including BeautifulSoup. Choose a library based on your requirements and familiarity with the tools.

Install the Required Libraries: Install the chosen library using pip, the Python package manager. For example, you can install BeautifulSoup using pip install beautifulsoup4.

Retrieve the HTML: Use a library like requests or Selenium to send an HTTP request to the website and retrieve the HTML content of the page.

Parse the HTML: Use the web scraping library to parse the HTML content and extract the desired data. This involves identifying and selecting specific HTML elements or CSS selectors to target.

Extract the Data: Once you've identified the relevant HTML elements, use the library's methods or functions to extract the desired data. This may involve navigating the HTML tree structure, accessing attributes, or retrieving text content.

Process and Store the Data: Perform any necessary data cleaning or processing on the extracted data. Then, store the data in a suitable format, such as CSV, Excel, JSON, or a database.

Handle Pagination and Iteration: If the data spans multiple pages or requires iterating through multiple URLs, implement logic to handle pagination or iteration to scrape all the desired data.

Respect Website Policies and Ethics: When scraping websites, make sure to comply with the website's terms of service, robots.txt file, and any other relevant policies. Be mindful of the website's bandwidth and avoid overloading the server with excessive requests.

Remember, web scraping practices can vary depending on the website and the specific requirements. It's essential to familiarize yourself with the legal and ethical considerations of web scraping and ensure that your scraping activities are aligned with those guidelines.
